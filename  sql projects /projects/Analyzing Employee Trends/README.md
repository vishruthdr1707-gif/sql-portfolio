# SQL Projects 1

In the scope of this project, our objective is to delve into the Walmart Sales data, investigating the performance of key branches and 
products, analyzing sales trends across various product categories, and examining customer behavior. The primary goal is to gain insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for sales strategies.

## Project Description
In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions.
Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset.
These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.


# SQL Projects 2

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and my capacity to analyze complex data. They exhibit my abilities in data investigation, visualization, and analysis.

## Project Description

This project involved performing extensive analysis on HR employee data to uncover insights and trends. The data contained information on employees across departments, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction, attrition and more.

I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.

## Tasks Performed [project 1 and 2]

- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset

- Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, distributions across various dimensions like department, age, education etc.

- Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand departmental trends

- Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high risk groups

- Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, job satisfaction to uncover drivers

- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria

- Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction, attrition based on criteria

- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements for complex analysis 

- Organized and presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership



## About SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. Key SQL capabilities:

- CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete data
- Joins - combine data from multiple tables
- Aggregate functions - summations, counts, averages on data
- Subqueries - nested queries for advanced operations
- Stored procedures - reusable routines for logic
- Window functions - analytics functions for rankings etc.

For these examples, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

## Usage

- Install a SQL database such as SQL Server Express
- Import any .sql files to run the queries
- Modify the queries for your own database
